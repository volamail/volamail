This page illustrates the basics of Volamail's editor.

## Generating a template from a prompt

You can generate a template from a prompt by entering it the prompt field near
the bottom of the editor. The LLM will generate a template based on the prompt.

<Callout type="info">
  The actual prompt that will be sent to the LLM is similar to this:

  "You are an email generator, given the following prompt generate an email: \{prompt\}".

  This means you don't need to provide the full prompt, just the part that comes after "generate an email:". So for example "An email inviting people to a party" would be enough.
</Callout>

## Editing a template

Once you've generated a template, you can edit it using the same prompt field you used to generate it. The LLM will now perform modifications to the template based on the prompt.

The LLM has context of the whole template, so you can ask very wide change such as "Make this email more colorful" or "Change the whole layout".

### Inline editing

Inline editing is a way to edit a single element of the template. You can select an element by clicking on it, a dialog will appear that will allow you to edit the element. You can either prompt the LLM for changes, or apply changes to specific properties of the element (such as changing the text contents).

<Callout type="warn">
  During inline editing, the LLM only has context about the element you're currently editing.

  This is a temporary limitation during the early access phase and will 100% be fixed in the very near future.
