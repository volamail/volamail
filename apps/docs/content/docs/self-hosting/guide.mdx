#### Prerequisites

You're gonna need a few things ready before you start:

- A PostgreSQL instance that you can connect to via connection URL (we use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/))
- An AWS account with an S3 bucket and Amazon SES configured in the same region. You'll need to generate an IAM user with access to these services (we recommend [this](https://sst.dev/chapters/create-an-iam-user.html) guide by SST)

### Hosting the web app

The web app is a [SolidStart](https://solidstart.com/) project and as such it can be deployed almost anywhere. The cloud hosted version of the web app is [app.volamail.com](https://app.volamail.com) and it's running on Vercel, but you can choose whatever works for you.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to deploy the web app:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Clone the repo

First you'll need to clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/volamail/volamail.git
```

The actual dashboard is inside the `apps/app` folder. So you'll need to navigate to that folder.

</Step>
<Step>

### Install dependencies

Next you'll need to install the dependencies with `pnpm`:

```bash
pnpm install
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Copy the .env.example file to a .env file and fill it out

The `.env.example` file should contain comments on the relevant environment variables.



</Step>

<Step>

### Run DB migrations

To run the database migrations you'll need to run:

```bash
pnpm db migrate
```

This command will use the `DATABASE_URL` from the `.env` file so make sure it's set up correctly.

</Step>

<Step>

### Try the development server

When you run `pnpm dev` you should see the dashboard running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can start creating a user by logging in at [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login) and see if everything works.

</Step>

<Step>

### Deploying the app

As mentioned before, the web app is a [SolidStart](https://solidstart.com/) project and the way it's deployed depends on the infrastructure you're using. Please follow the appropriate guide for your infrastructure from [the Deploy section](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy) on the Nitro docs.

## FAQ

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Can I use an SMTP server instead of SES?">
Not for now. We're working on abstracting the sending layer a bit so you can plug in either SES, SMTP or any other provider.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use a different LLM?">
Yes. In the `.env` file you can choose any model provided by the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/foundations/providers-and-models) (including custom ones that are compatible with the OpenAI API). 

If you're unsure, we recommend Anthropic's Claude models, we found them to be the best for this use case, and it's what we use in the cloud hosted version.
