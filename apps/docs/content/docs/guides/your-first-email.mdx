This article will walk you through sending your first _transactional_ email. From first login, to creating an email and finally sending it via an API call.

<Steps>
<Step>
### First login

After you get approved for the early access phase, you should be able to log in to the platform at [app.volamail.com](https://app.volamail.com).

When you log in you should see a project called "Untitled Project" at the top left of the screen. This is your default personal project that gets created when you first log in.
</Step>

### Creating an email

From the `Emails` tab on your dashboard you're able to manage and create your emails. 

When you create an email you'll get redirected to the editor. You can start from an existing HTML email or start from scratch by prompting the AI for an idea.
</Step>
<Step>
### Iterating on the design

The editor allows you to select each element of the email and prompt the AI for changes, or apply global changes with the prompt below the email (like "Make it dark mode" or "Change the whole layout").

Once you're done, you should set an `Identifier` (this will be used to specify the email when calling the API) and a Subject.
</Step>

### Sending via API

Sending the email is as simple as an HTTP call:

```js
fetch("https://api.volamail.com/send", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    token: process.env.VOLAMAIL_API_TOKEN,
    template: "my-first-email",
    data: {
      // variables go here
      first_name: "John",
      last_name: "Doe"
    }
  })
})
```

The API token can be generated from the "API Tokens" section in the dashboard.
